**PASSWORD MANAGER**

**Description**

The project's main purpose is to assist users in generating and managing their passwords and notes. Here's a more detailed description of the project:

1. Password Generation:

    Users can generate random passwords of a specified length.
    Passwords can include a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

2. Password Encryption and Decryption:

    Users can enter a text and a secret key to encrypt the text.
    The program uses the PBE (Password-Based Encryption) algorithm to encrypt the text.
    Users can also decrypt the encrypted text using the same secret key.

3. Password Storage and Retrieval:

    Users can store their account names and associated passwords.
    The program uses a hash table for efficient storage and retrieval of account/password pairs.
    Users can search for stored passwords by entering the account name.

4. Note Storage and Retrieval:

    Users can add and store notes.
    Notes are stored in an ArrayList.
    Users can retrieve their notes.

5. GUI (Graphical User Interface):

    The application provides a user-friendly GUI using Java's Swing library.
    Users can interact with the application through buttons, text fields, and text areas.

6. Loading Screen:

    The project includes a simple loading screen that appears before the main application window is displayed.

7. Secure Password Management:

    Passwords are stored using encryption for security.
    Users can retrieve encrypted passwords using the correct secret key.

8. Robust Error Handling:

    The application includes error handling to ensure that user inputs are validated and handled appropriately.
    Error messages are displayed using JOptionPane.

9. Code Structure:

    The code is organized into different classes, each responsible for specific functionalities.
    This modular structure enhances code readability and maintainability.

10. User Interaction:

    Users can interact with the application by clicking buttons, entering text, and receiving messages and results via dialog boxes.

This project is intended to be a simple tool for managing passwords and notes. While it's a basic implementation, it demonstrates various programming concepts, such as GUI development, data storage, encryption, and error handling. 
Users can use this application to generate secure passwords, store and retrieve account credentials, and manage personal notes.
